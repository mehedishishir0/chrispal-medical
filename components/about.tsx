              About Our Clinic
            </h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              Healthcare is a vital and emotive issue—its importance pervades
              all aspects of societies. The long-term goal of the proposed
              medical centre- CHRISPAL MEDICAL is to provide patients with the
              necessary services required to live a healthy life in a convenient
              and safe “one-stop” location. CHRISPAL MEDICAL is poised to be a
              community-based and patient-directed medical centre delivering
              comprehensive, culturally competent, high-quality, primary health
              care services to individuals and their families. The facility will
              provide an extremely valuable and well sought- after medical
              service to Christiana, Spalding and surrounding communities in
              central Manchester. The name CHRISPAL stems from the desire to
              serve the Christiana/Spalding community (CHRIS- Christiana, SPAL-
              Spalding).  CHRISPAL MEDICAL will be a multi-speciality healthcare
              centre. A retail pharmacy, a radiology suite, a laboratory, and an
              ambulance dispatch unit will also be located on the compound.
              There will be an in-house family physician, along with consulting
              physicians providing speciality care such as orthopaedics, general
              surgery, neurosurgery, cardiology, physiotherapist and OBGYN among
              others. The aim is to bring the specialists to the community as
              opposed to having individuals from the community leave in search
              of these specialists. This will save them time, hassle and money.
              The ability of patients to seek out specialists is frequently
              limited by convenience, logistics and or finances. Inevitably,
              patients facing such barriers will receive deficient medical care.
              By integrating access to multiple specialities, pharmacy,
              laboratory and emergency transportation in a single location,
              patients will be exposed to adequate, affordable health services
              currently limited by economic, geographic, and/or cultural
              barriers.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              Due to the near-universal desire for safe and good-quality
              healthcare, there is a growing interest in international
              healthcare accreditation. Providing healthcare, especially of the
              appropriate standard, is a complex and challenging process. As
              such CHRISPAL MEDICAL intends to obtain Global Clinic Rating
              (GCR™) international accreditation within the first 2 years of
              service. GCR International Accreditation means that a clinic has
              been officially proven to be at or above international standards.
              GCR International Accreditation shows that a clinic has been
              officially monitored, independently checked on quality, and is
              using the data collected by the GCR to help them improve the level
              of expertise, facilities, services, and patient care. It shows
              that the clinic has demonstrated that they provide the same or
              higher quality of treatment as all other clinics that display the
              GCR accreditation star. The process will begin with becoming a
              member of GCR International (Application already made, awaiting
              building permission, and registration). The advantage of beginning
              the process this early is that the clinic will be designed,
              outfitted, and operated according to international standards from
              Day 1 of commencement. The intention is to hire staff as much as
              possible from the community. The owners are “fruits” of the
              community. Several of the specialists who have shown interest such
              as the neurosurgeon, the orthopaedic surgeon, the
              obstetrician/gynaecologist, and the pharmacist are also “fruits”
              of the community. Hence our motto is “from the people for the
              people”. It is of priority that all staff employed at the facility
              are culturally competent to care for individuals in this rural
              community. They must have the ability to provide care to patients
              with diverse values, beliefs and behaviours, including the
              tailoring of health care delivery to meet patients&#39; social,
              cultural and intellectual needs. <br />{" "}
              <span className="text-2xl font-bold text-black ">The Market</span>{" "}
              <br /> The type of service that CHRISPAL MEDICAL will be providing
              is almost non-existent from the private sector in the Christiana
              region. There are government health centres that provide similar
              services that CHRISPAL MEDICAL will be providing but not as
              comprehensive. The anecdotal reports of prolonged delays, lack of
              personal attention, diminishing quality of service, lack of
              specialty care provided by the public health centres leave the
              market wide open for comprehensive private medical care.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              CHRISPAL MEDICAL will employ many strategies to differentiate
              themselves from the existing markets. Bench marking patient
              service is the way CHRISPAL MEDICAL will corner the market of the
              industry that is in desperate need of the proposed comprehensive
              services. In addition, CHRISPAL MEDICAL will provide adequate
              customer parking spaces on the compound in accordance with
              recommendations by the relevant authorities. This is currently
              lacking at other medical facilities resulting in major
              inconvenience for many patients. The Customers CHRISPAL MEDICAL is
              an exciting opportunity poised to provide a desperately needed
              diverse healthcare service to the people in Christiana, Spalding
              and their surrounding communities. CHRISPAL MEDICAL will cater to
              all age groups. It is difficult to speculate the percentage from
              each group, but all groups are expected to be a continued source
              of new patients. Christiana is the second most populous town in
              Manchester after Mandeville, accounting for more than 5% of the
              parish population. Reportedly, there has been an increase in the
              population of 16.6% from year 2000 to 2015.
              (https://www.city-facts.com/christiana-jamaica ). The current
              population in Christiana is estimated at 17,360, plus an
              additional 38,249 from neighbouring communities spanning
              Chudleigh, Craig Head, Contrivance, Devon, Hopeton, Litchfield,
              Mile Gully, Mizpath, Spaldings, Pike, Aenon Town, Alston,
              Sangunetti, Ritchies, Frankfield, James Hill, Albert Town,
              Wait-a-Bit, Troy, Ulster Spring, Warsop, and Cave Valley (other
              contributing communities may have been omitted). THESE ESTIMATED
